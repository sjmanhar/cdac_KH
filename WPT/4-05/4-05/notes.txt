API: Application Programming Interface

train search, pnr status, ticket booking, cancel 

Using API we can use functionalities and services of one application into another application


API's can be accessed cross technology

mobile app -> android java, ios objective c
website -> react js/ angular



Securing api using login authentication:


restaurant-> self service

payment counter -> token 
food counter -> token -> 

resource -> food 
security -> payment

Admin -> login api -> validations on username and password -> successful or failure

GET /student 
DELETE /student/:id 
PUT /student/:id


how to generate the token at the time of login:


we will use JWT (JSON Web Token)

payload: json data that token should carry

while creating a token we can mention the payload as json object

part1.part2.part3

part1 : header -> type, alg
part2: payload
part3: signature-> secret key

jsonwebtoken -> sign(payload,"secret-key") will create a token 




Admin -> login api -> validations on username and password -> successful or failure

GET /student 
DELETE /student/:id 
PUT /student/:id
POST /student

in secured apis, token will be passed into the request header & name of that header is Authorization

middleware:
1. read token value from request Authorization header
2. check token existance
3. if token is there in Authorization header then verify the token validity
   if token is valid -> next();
	if token is not valid -> respond with error message 
4. if token is not there in Authorization header:
	
	respond with error message 


demo.js:
var x;
x=6;
export default x;

if only single property has to be exported from a js file and that is too after its declaration and initialization, so in this case we should use "export default"
